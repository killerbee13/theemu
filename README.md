# theemu
meemu themes and localizations, for meemu.org!


to use, clone the repo then run

`rsync -av --files-from ./meemu-theme.txt . your/mastodon/dev/code/`

deploy the same way

`rsync -av --files-from ./meemu-theme.txt . yourname@yourServer:/your/mastodon/root`


you probably don't want to change your en.json or en.yml, so remove those from meemu-theme.txt 

if you use them, credit to catgoat@meemu.org would be cool! if you have tweaks or fixes, pull requests are welcome ðŸ’œ. 

the vaporwave theme is appropriately glitchy, but the purple theme is in good shape (and the default on meemu.org!)
